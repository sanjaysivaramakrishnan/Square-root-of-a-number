# Find the square root of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the square root of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function.
2. Assign number_iters = 100 in the function to perform 100 iteratios.
3. Set i = 0.
4. Calculate  number = 0.5 * (number + a / number) for 100 iterations.
5. Return number

## Program:
```
/*

def hello():<br>
    x=int(input())<br>
    approx=0.5*x<br>
    better=0.5*(approx+x/approx)<br>
    while better!=approx:<br>
        approx=better<br>
        better=0.5*(approx+x/approx)<br>
    print(f"Square root of the number: {better}")<br>
hello()<br>
 
*/
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the square root for the given number(newton's method) using function is written and verified using python programming.
